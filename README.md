## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers

## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

## Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

## Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
 AgriSage: A Smart Crop Companion for Every Farmer
AgriSage is a multilingual, AI-powered mobile and voice-enabled advisory platform tailored for small and marginal farmers. It integrates hyperlocal data, satellite imagery, and farmer-generated inputs to deliver real-time, personalized guidance on crop selection, soil health, pest control, and market trends. The system uses a conversational chatbot with voice support in regional languages, enabling even low-literate users to interact seamlessly.
Key innovations:
- AI-driven crop recommendation engine based on soil, weather, and historical yield data.
- Pest and disease detection via image recognition using smartphone cameras.
- Predictive weather alerts and irrigation scheduling.
- Local market price tracking and selling tips.
- Offline functionality with periodic sync for areas with poor connectivity.

Technical Approach
## Modular Architecture for Scalable Deployment
- Frontend: Flutter-based mobile app with voice and text interfaces.
- Backend: Python (FastAPI) with AI models in TensorFlow/PyTorch; PostgreSQL for data storage.
- AI Modules:
- Crop recommendation using decision trees and regression models.
- Pest detection via CNN-based image classification.
- Weather prediction using APIs from IMD and satellite feeds.
- Localization: NLP models trained on regional dialects for Tamil, Punjabi, Hindi, etc.
- Integration: APIs for soil health cards, mandi prices, and weather services.
## Implementation Flow:
- Farmer inputs location, soil type, and crop history.
- AI engine processes data and recommends crops, fertilizers, and pest control.
- Farmer uploads pest images for diagnosis.
- App sends weather alerts and market updates.
- Feedback loop improves model accuracy over time.

Feasibility and Viability
## Grounded in Reality, Built for Scale
- Feasibility: Uses existing infrastructure (smartphones, IMD data, soil health cards).
- Challenges:
- Low digital literacy → solved via voice and visual UI.
- Connectivity issues → offline-first design.
- Trust deficit → community champions and extension officers as ambassadors.
- Risk Mitigation:
- Pilot in one district with iterative feedback.
- Partner with Krishi Vigyan Kendras and NGOs for outreach.
- Continuous model retraining with anonymized usage data.

## Impact and Benefits
🌱 Transforming Agriculture, One Farmer at a Time
- Social: Empowers farmers with knowledge, reducing dependency on middlemen.
- Economic: Optimized input use and better crop choices increase income by 20–30%.
- Environmental: Reduces chemical overuse, promotes sustainable practices.
- Scalability: Can be replicated across states with minimal customization.
- Inclusivity: Designed for women farmers and tribal communities with tailored content.
